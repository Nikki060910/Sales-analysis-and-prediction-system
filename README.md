# Car Sales Analysis And Prediction System Project

## Project Overview

This project explores a car sales dataset to uncover key sales patterns such as the most sold car models, the years with highest sales counts, and the distribution of sales across different fuel types. The analysis helps understand market demand trends and consumer preferences.

## Data Source

* Dataset: Car sales dataset (loaded in Jupyter Notebook) 
* Includes features such as car name, model year, selling price, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and mileage.

## Analysis Methods

* Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with bar charts and count plots
* Trend analysis for most sold years, fuel type distribution, and top-selling car brands
* Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn

## Key Findings

* Identified the year with the highest number of car sales
* Determined which car brands/models are sold the most
* Found the most common fuel types preferred by buyers
* Observed patterns that indicate market demand shifts over time

## How to Run

* Open **`Untitled20.ipynb`** to view the complete analysis, code, and visualizations
* Requirements: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
* Run the original notebook (`ipynb` version) for editable analysis
